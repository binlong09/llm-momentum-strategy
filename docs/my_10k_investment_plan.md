### Option B: Concentrated 20-Stock Portfolio (Easier to Manage)

## 🎯 My Recommendation for $10,000

**Go with Option B (20 stocks)** because:
- ✅ Easier to execute (20 trades vs 50)
- ✅ Lower transaction costs
- ✅ Simpler to track
- ✅ Still captures the high-conviction LLM signals
- ✅ Each position is meaningful ($500 vs $134-$409)
- ✅ More practical for monthly rebalancing

**Minimum position size reasoning:**
- $500 minimum keeps positions meaningful
- Easier to trade (avoid odd lots)
- Lower relative impact of spreads

---

## 📝 Execution Plan (Today, Nov 5, 2025)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Broker
- Login to your brokerage account
- Ensure you have **$10,000 cash** ready
- Check trading hours: **9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET**
- Best execution time: **10:00 AM - 3:00 PM ET** (most liquid)

### Step 2: Execute Trades
**Use this exact order list:**

```
BUY ORDERS (Market open 10:00 AM - 3:00 PM ET)
==============================================

High Conviction (LLM Score 1.0):
- APP:   $500 (Market/Limit order)
- IBKR:  $500
- GLW:   $500
- DASH:  $500
- COIN:  $500
- AVGO:  $500
- APH:   $500
- GEV:   $500
- HWM:   $500
- GOOGL: $500
- JPM:   $500
- BK:    $500

Mid Conviction (LLM Score 0.6):
- COF:   $500
- C:     $500
- LRCX:  $500
- CRWD:  $500
- AXON:  $500
- JBL:   $500
- CCL:   $500
- INTC:  $500

Total: $10,000 across 20 positions
```

### Step 3: Order Type Recommendations
- **High conviction stocks (APP, IBKR, etc.)**: Use **limit orders** at current ask + 0.5%
- **Large caps (GOOGL, JPM)**: Use **market orders** (very liquid)
- **Avoid**: Market orders on low-volume stocks

### Step 4: Record Your Trades
Keep a spreadsheet with:
- Symbol
- Shares purchased
- Entry price
- Entry date
- Position value
- Notes

## 🚫 Stop Loss / Stop Profit Strategy

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This Strategy Does NOT Use Traditional Stop Losses

**Why no stop losses?**
1. **Monthly rebalancing** is the risk management mechanism
2. Academic paper shows stop losses **hurt** momentum strategies
3. Momentum stocks are **volatile** - stop losses trigger too often
4. Strategy expects **20-40% drawdowns** - stops would exit prematurely

### Instead, Use These Risk Controls:

#### 1. **Monthly Rebalancing (Primary Risk Management)**
- **When**: First trading day of each month
- **What**: Regenerate portfolio, sell losers, buy new winners
- **Why**: Automatically exits underperforming stocks monthly

#### 2. **Portfolio-Level Stop Loss (Optional, Conservative)**
If you're risk-averse, use a **portfolio-level** stop:
- **Trigger**: If total portfolio drops **25% from peak**
- **Action**: Exit entire strategy (sell all 20 stocks)
- **Recovery**: Wait 3 months, re-enter
- **Note**: This will likely reduce returns vs full strategy

#### 3. **Individual Stock Emergency Exit (Rare)**
Only exit a stock mid-month if:
- 🚨 **Bankruptcy announcement**
- 🚨 **Fraud scandal** (Enron-style)
- 🚨 **Delisting notice**
- 🚨 **-50% single-day crash** (circuit breaker)

**DO NOT exit for:**
- ❌ -10% to -20% drops (normal volatility)
- ❌ Negative earnings report
- ❌ Analyst downgrade
- ❌ Market correction

#### 4. **Take Profit Strategy**
**No explicit profit taking.** Let winners run until next rebalance.

**Why?**
- Momentum strategies work by **riding trends**
- Selling winners early = **cutting your best performers**
- Monthly rebalance naturally **trims overweight positions**

## 📊 How to Track Your Portfolio

### Option 1: Simple Spreadsheet (Recommended)

**Create this Google Sheet / Excel:**

| Symbol | Shares | Entry Price | Entry Date | Current Price | Current Value | P&L $ | P&L % | LLM Score | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------------|------------|---------------|---------------|-------|-------|-----------|-------|
| APP    | X      | $XX.XX      | 2025-11-05 | $XX.XX        | $XXX          | $XXX  | XX%   | 1.0       |       |
| IBKR   | X      | $XX.XX      | 2025-11-05 | $XX.XX        | $XXX          | $XXX  | XX%   | 1.0       |       |
| ...    |        |             |            |               |               |       |       |           |       |
| **TOTAL** |     |             |            |               | **$XX,XXX**   | **$XXX** | **XX%** |     |       |

**Update frequency**: Daily or weekly (takes 5 minutes)

**Download template**:
```bash
# I'll create one for you below
```

### Option 2: Portfolio Tracking Apps

**Free options:**
- **Google Sheets** with GOOGLEFINANCE() function
- **Yahoo Finance Portfolio** (free)
- **Personal Capital** (free, automatic sync)
- **Robinhood** (if that's your broker)

**Paid options** ($10-20/month):
- **Sharesight**
- **Kubera**
- **Morningstar Portfolio Manager**

### Option 3: Broker's Built-in Tracking

Most brokers show:
- ✅ Total portfolio value
- ✅ Individual position P&L
- ✅ Daily return
- ⚠️ But may not track strategy-specific metrics

## 📅 Monthly Rebalancing Checklist

**On first trading day of each month:**

- [ ] Generate new portfolio: `python scripts/generate_portfolio.py --size 20`
- [ ] Compare with current holdings
- [ ] Identify:
  - Stocks to **SELL** (no longer in new portfolio)
  - Stocks to **BUY** (new additions)
  - Stocks to **HOLD** (in both, but check if rebalancing needed)
- [ ] Execute trades during 10 AM - 3 PM ET
- [ ] Update tracking spreadsheet
- [ ] Save portfolio CSV for next month

**Expected turnover**: 30-40% monthly (6-8 stock changes)

---

## 📈 Performance Expectations (Realistic)

### Year 1 (Based on Backtest Results)
**Best case** (bull market like 2024):
- Return: +18% to +23%
- Your $10,000 → $11,800 to $12,300

**Average case** (normal market):
- Return: +10% to +15%
- Your $10,000 → $11,000 to $11,500

**Worst case** (bear market):
- Return: -10% to -30%
- Your $10,000 → $7,000 to $9,000
- Max drawdown: **-40% possible**

### 3-Year Outlook
- Expected cumulative: +35% to +60%
- Your $10,000 → $13,500 to $16,000
- Expect **at least one -20% drawdown**

---

## ⚠️ Critical Warnings

### 1. **Risk Disclosure**
- ✅ This is a **HIGH-RISK** momentum strategy
- ✅ Expect **20-40% drawdowns** (your $10K could drop to $6K-$8K)
- ✅ You need **strong conviction** to hold through crashes
- ✅ Best for **long-term investors** (3+ year horizon)

### 2. **Tax Implications**
- ⚠️ **Monthly rebalancing = lots of short-term trades**
- ⚠️ **Short-term capital gains** taxed as ordinary income (up to 37%)
- ⚠️ **Strongly recommend using IRA/Roth IRA** for this strategy
- ⚠️ If using taxable account, expect **high tax bill**

### 3. **Transaction Costs**
- Commission-free brokers: **$0 per trade** ✅
- Bid-ask spreads: **~$1-5 per trade** (estimate $40-100/month)
- Annual cost: **~$500-1,200** in spread costs
- Keep account at **commission-free broker** (Robinhood, IBKR, etc.)

### 4. **Time Commitment**
- **Initial setup**: 2-3 hours (today)
- **Monthly rebalancing**: 30-60 minutes (first day of month)
- **Monitoring**: 5-10 minutes/week (optional)
- **Annual**: ~12-15 hours total

### 5. **Market Regime Sensitivity**
- ✅ Works **best** in bull markets (2024: +23%)
- ⚠️ Works **OK** in sideways markets (2019-2023: +11%)
- ❌ Will **lose money** in bear markets (2022-style: -30%+)
- Cannot predict which regime we're in!

## 📞 What to Do If...

### Scenario 1: Portfolio Down 15% in First Month
**Action**: **DO NOTHING**
- This is normal volatility
- Wait for monthly rebalance
- Review position, but don't panic sell

### Scenario 2: Portfolio Down 25% in 3 Months
**Action**: **Evaluate Risk Tolerance**
- If you can't sleep: Consider exiting strategy
- If you're OK: Continue monthly rebalancing
- Remember: Backtests showed -42% max drawdown

### Scenario 3: Single Stock Drops 30%
**Action**: **Wait for Monthly Rebalance**
- Unless it's fraud/bankruptcy, hold
- Let monthly rebalance automatically exit if no longer top 50

### Scenario 4: Portfolio Up 30% in 6 Months
**Action**: **Keep Going!**
- Don't take profits early
- Continue monthly rebalancing
- This is what momentum strategies do in bull markets

### Scenario 5: Can't Execute All 20 Trades
**Action**: **Prioritize High-Conviction Stocks**
- Execute the 12 stocks with LLM score 1.0 first
- Fill remaining with mid-tier stocks if time allows
