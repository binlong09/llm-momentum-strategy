### 🟡 MONITOR CLOSELY (Research, Usually Hold)

**In these scenarios:**

1. **Earnings Miss**
   - Missed by <10%, guidance maintained
   - Stock down 10-15%
   - Company still profitable and growing
   - **Example:** "We grew 20% instead of expected 25%"
   - **Action:** READ earnings call transcript → Usually HOLD
   - **Why:** One miss doesn't break momentum

2. **Analyst Downgrade**
   - Single analyst downgrade (not consensus)
   - No fundamental change
   - Stock down 5-12%
   - **Example:** "Morgan Stanley downgrades from Buy to Hold"
   - **Action:** Check if other analysts agree → Usually HOLD
   - **Why:** Analyst opinions are often noise

3. **CEO/Executive Departure**
   - Planned succession announced
   - Retirement or "spend time with family"
   - Stock down <15%
   - **Example:** CEO stepping down after 10 years

4. **Sector Rotation**
   - Whole sector down together
   - No company-specific news
   - Market-wide sell-off
   - **Example:** All tech stocks down 5-8%

   - **Why:** Temporary sector weakness is normal

5. **Guidance Cut**

   - External factors (economy, rates)
   - Stock down 10-15%
   - **Example:** "Growth forecast 15% vs prior 18%"

| Warning Drop | 10-15% | ⚠️ Warning | Research, monitor |
| Significant Drop | 5-10% | ℹ️ Info | Note, no action |
| Normal Move | <5% | None | Ignore |

**Decision tree:**
```
Stock dropped >15%

├─ No specific news (market-wide)? → HOLD
└─ Momentum still intact? → HOLD
```

---

### News Alerts

| Red Flags (SELL) | Warnings (MONITOR) | Positive (HOLD) |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Fraud allegations | Earnings miss | Earnings beat |
| SEC investigation | Analyst downgrade | Analyst upgrade |
| Bankruptcy filing | Layoffs announced | Product launch |
| Criminal charges | Revenue decline | Partnership deal |
| Accounting scandal | CEO departure | Acquisition |
| Product recall (major) | Guidance cut | Record revenue |

**Decision tree:**
```
News alert received
├─ Red flag keyword? → SELL immediately
├─ Multiple warnings? → Research deeply, consider selling
├─ Single warning? → Monitor, usually hold

```

---

### Concentration Alerts

| Weight | Severity | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| >30% | 🚨 Critical | Reduce immediately |
| 20-30% | ⚠️ Warning | Reduce at next rebalance |
| 10-20% | ℹ️ Info | Normal for momentum |
| <10% | None | Healthy |

**Why it matters:**
- Single stock >30% = Too risky (if it drops 50%, you lose 15% of portfolio)
- Diversification protects against individual stock risk
- Momentum naturally creates concentration (winners get bigger)
- Monthly rebalancing keeps it in check

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Panic Selling on Normal Volatility

**Scenario:**
```
Stock down 8% on no news
You panic and sell
Next day: Stock bounces back 10%
```

**Why it's wrong:**
- 5-10% moves are NORMAL
- Momentum stocks are volatile
- Selling = locking in losses
- You bought for momentum, not stability

**Correct approach:**
- Only sell on >15% drops with bad news
- Trust the monthly rebalance process
- Volatility ≠ broken momentum

---

### ❌ Mistake #2: Ignoring Red Flags

**Scenario:**
```
Alert: Company under fraud investigation
You think: "It'll blow over, I'll hold"
Result: Stock down 60%, investigation proven
```

**Why it's wrong:**
- Red flags rarely "blow over"
- Hope is not a strategy
- Momentum doesn't survive scandals

**Correct approach:**
- Take red flag alerts seriously
- When in doubt, SELL and move on
- Better safe than sorry

---

### ❌ Mistake #3: Overreacting to Analyst Noise

**Scenario:**
```
Single analyst downgrades stock
You panic and sell immediately
Stock continues momentum, up 25% next month
```

**Why it's wrong:**
- Analysts are often wrong
- One opinion ≠ trend
- You sold a winner on noise

**Correct approach:**
- Check if it's consensus or outlier
- Look at data, not opinions
- Hold unless fundamentals changed

---

### ❌ Mistake #4: Cutting Winners Too Early

**Scenario:**
```
Stock up 20%, you take profits
Stock continues to 80%+ gain
You left 60% on the table
```

**Why it's wrong:**
- Momentum stocks can run for months
- Cutting winners = capping your upside
- Best performers need time

**Correct approach:**
- Let winners run until monthly rebalance
- Only trim if concentration risk (>20%)
- Momentum = riding trends, not timing tops

---

### ❌ Mistake #5: Death by 1000 Cuts

**Scenario:**
```
You sell stocks on every 10% dip
End up with cash as market rallies
Miss gains while "waiting for entry"
```

**Why it's wrong:**
- Market timing doesn't work
- Momentum persists through dips
- You can't predict bottoms

**Correct approach:**
- Stick to monthly rebalance schedule
- Only sell on critical alerts
- Accept volatility as part of the game

---
